            Gun violence is a serious issue in the United States. On average, 100 people are either killed or injured by guns. The bar chart below groups gun violence casualties by month and plots the count, separated by killed vs. injured against time. It is worth noting that the low numbers in 2013 occurred due to unrecorded incidents during that period. The number of casualties caused by shootings are still steadily increasing over the time period of 2013-2018.
